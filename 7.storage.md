### Storage PVC

###### The application stores logs at location /log/app.log. View the logs.
```
kubectl exec webapp -- cat /log/app.log
```

###### If the logs are stored in the Container's file system that lives only as long as the Container does. Once the pod is destroyed, you cannot view the logs again.

###### Configure a volume to store these logs at /var/log/webapp on the host.
```

give the properties under spec.volumes and spec.containers.volumeMounts.

###### Create a Persistent Volume with the given specification.Volume Name: pv-log,Storage: 100Mi,Access Modes: ReadWriteMany,Host Path: /pv/log,Reclaim Policy: Retain
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-log
spec:
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  capacity:
    storage: 100Mi
  hostPath:
    path: /pv/log
```

###### Let us claim some of that storage for our application. Create a Persistent Volume Claim with the given specification. Volume Name: claim-log-1,Storage Request: 50Mi,Access Modes: ReadWriteOnce
```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: claim-log-1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Mi
```

###### If pv and pvc are not bounded, check if there is any access mismatch
```
kubectl get pv,pvc
```

###### Update the Access Mode on the claim to bind it to the PV. 
```
Edit pvc.yaml access mode
 k replace -f pvc.yaml --force
```

###### Update the webapp pod to use the persistent volume claim as its storage.Replace hostPath configured earlier with the newly created PersistentVolumeClaim.
```

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: event-simulator
    image: kodekloud/event-simulator
    env:
    - name: LOG_HANDLERS
      value: file
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /log
      name: log-volume

  volumes:
  - name: log-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: claim-log-1

```

###### What is the Reclaim Policy set on the Persistent Volume pv-log?
```
k get pv
```

###### What if pvc was destroyed, what happens to pv
```
pv will not be destroyed but no available
```

###### The PVC was still being used by the webapp pod when we issued the delete command. Until the pod is deleted, the PVC will remain in a terminating state.

### Storage classes

###### How many StorageClasses exist in the cluster right now?
```
kubectl get sc
```

###### What is the name of the Storage Class that does not support dynamic volume provisioning?
```
Look for the storage class name that uses no-provisioner
```

###### What is the Volume Binding Mode used for this storage class
```
 kubectl describe sc local-storage
```
###### Create a new PersistentVolumeClaim by the name of local-pvc that should bind to the volume local-pv.
```
---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: local-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: local-storage
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi
```

###### Why is the PVC in a pending state despite making a valid request to claim the volume called local-pv?

```
The StorageClass used by the PVC uses WaitForFirstConsumer volume binding mode. This means that the persistent volume will not bind to the claim until a pod makes use of the PVC to request storage.
```

###### The Storage Class called local-storage makes use of VolumeBindingMode set to WaitForFirstConsumer. This will delay the binding and provisioning of a PersistentVolume until a Pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim is created.

###### Create a new pod called nginx with the image nginx:alpine. The Pod should make use of the PVC local-pvc and mount the volume at the path /var/www/html.The PV local-pv should in a bound state.
